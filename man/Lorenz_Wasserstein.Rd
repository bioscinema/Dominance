\title{Wasserstein-1 distance between dominance Lorenz curves
This function computes pairwise Wasserstein-1 distances (a.k.a. Earth
Mover's Distance) between samples based on their dominance Lorenz
curves. Given a Lorenz matrix of size \eqn{K \times n}, where rows
correspond to ranked taxa and columns correspond to samples, the
Wasserstein distance between samples \eqn{i} and \eqn{j} is:
\deqn{
  W_1(L_i, L_j) = \frac{1}{K} \sum_{k=1}^K | L_i(k) - L_j(k) |,
}
which represents the discrete integral of the absolute difference
between the two Lorenz curves.}
\usage{
Lorenz_Wasserstein(lorenz_matrix)
}
\arguments{
\item{lorenz_matrix}{A numeric matrix of dimension \eqn{K \times n},
where each column is a dominance Lorenz curve (e.g., output from
\code{\link{dominance_lorenz}}).}
}
\value{
A \code{dist} object containing the pairwise Wasserstein-1
distances between samples.
