\title{Polar ordination along a dominance (Gini) gradient}
\usage{
polar_ordination(dist_obj, alpha_dom)
}
\arguments{
\item{dist_obj}{A \code{dist} object or a symmetric numeric matrix
containing pairwise distances between samples (e.g., output from
\code{\link{Lorenz_Wasserstein}}).}

\item{alpha_dom}{A \code{data.frame} returned by
\code{\link{alpha_dominance}}, with row names corresponding to
sample IDs and a column named \code{"Gini"}. If a column named
\code{"scarcity"} is present, it will be included in the output.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} with one row per sample and columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{sample} — sample ID
\item \code{Axis} — 1D ordination coordinate in \link{0, 1}
\item \code{Gini} — dominance Gini for the sample
\item \code{scarcity} — (optional) scarcity from \code{alpha_dom},
if available
}
}
\description{
This function constructs a 1D ordination axis that interpolates
samples between two poles defined by minimum and maximum Gini
dominance. Given a distance object (or symmetric distance matrix)
and the output of \code{\link{alpha_dominance}}, it:
\enumerate{
\item aligns samples between the distance matrix and the
alpha-dominance summary;
\item identifies the samples with minimum and maximum \code{Gini}
as the two poles (axis=0 and axis=1);
\item maps each sample to a position between 0 and 1 based on
its distance to the minimum-Gini pole, normalized by the
distance between the two poles.
}
}
\details{
Let \eqn{s_{\min}} and \eqn{s_{\max}} be the samples with minimum and
maximum Gini dominance, and let \eqn{d(s_{\min}, s_{\max})} be their
pairwise distance. For any sample \eqn{s}, its coordinate is defined as
\deqn{
  \text{Axis}(s) = \frac{d(s_{\min}, s)}{d(s_{\min}, s_{\max})},
}
with \eqn{\text{Axis}(s_{\min}) = 0} and \eqn{\text{Axis}(s_{\max}) = 1}.

If all valid Gini values are identical (i.e., no minimum/maximum
separation), or if the distance between the two poles is zero, the
function stops with an error.
